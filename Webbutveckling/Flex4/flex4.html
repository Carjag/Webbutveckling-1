            <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has 
                been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
                took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived 
                not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <span style="color:red"> remaining essentially 
                unchanged. </span> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
                sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
                like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
